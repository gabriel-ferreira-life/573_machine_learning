# 573 Machine Learning

Welcome to the `573_Machine_Learning` repository! This repository contains all the assignments, projects, and theoretical explorations completed as part of the **573 Machine Learning** course for my Master's degree program. Each module within this repository will cover various machine learning concepts, ranging from foundational algorithms to advanced topics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two primary folders:

- **Homework**: This folder contains all homework assignments completed throughout the course. Each homework focuses on implementing and analyzing specific machine learning concepts, including:
  - **Linear Models**: Implementation of linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Performance analysis using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  - **Theoretical Derivations**: Mathematical derivations for optimization problems, dual problem formulation, and kernel properties.

- **Class Project**: This folder includes projects that apply machine learning techniques to real-world datasets. Each project involves the following components:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for model training.
  - **Model Building and Evaluation**: Implementation of various machine learning models, tuning hyperparameters, and comparing model performance.
  - **Visualization and Insights**: Visualization of results and key insights derived from the models.

## Course Overview

The **573 Machine Learning** course provides a comprehensive overview of machine learning algorithms and techniques, focusing on the following core topics:

- **Supervised Learning**: Linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and ensemble methods.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.
- **Theoretical Foundations**: Mathematical derivations for optimization, dual problem formulations, and kernel methods.
- **Practical Implementation**: Real-world applications of machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and performance tuning.
