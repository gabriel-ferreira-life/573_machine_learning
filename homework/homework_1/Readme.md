# Homework 1 - Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Perceptron

This repository contains implementations and experiments involving three core machine learning concepts: **Linear Regression**, **Linear Perceptron**, and **Logistic Regression**. The task focused on using these models to classify handwritten digits '1' and '5'.

## Summary

We explored the performance of a **Perceptron** model for distinguishing between handwritten digits '1' and '5', based on two key features: **symmetry** and **average intensity**. After training the model, we evaluated its accuracy across different iteration counts and visualized the decision boundary.

### Key Results:
- The Perceptron model achieved approximately **94.7% accuracy** on the test set.
- Performance remained stable across different iteration limits, indicating early convergence of the model.

### Key Highlights:
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was converted into two-dimensional features for classification.
- **Model Training**: The Perceptron learned to separate the two classes based on the feature set.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy on the test set remained consistent across varying iteration counts, suggesting the dataset is linearly separable.
