# 573 Machine Learning - Homework Overview

This repository contains the homework assignments completed as part of the **573 Machine Learning** course for my Master's degree program. Each homework explores different machine learning topics and techniques, ranging from fundamental algorithms to more advanced concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each homework assignment and class project:

- **Homework 1 - Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Perceptron**: 
  Implements and evaluates three fundamental machine learning models using a handwritten digit dataset. The focus is on classifying digits '1' and '5' using different model architectures and analyzing their performance.

- **Homework 2 - Support Vector Machine**:
  Focuses on the theoretical derivation and implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM). The assignment includes hand calculations for the dual problem formulation and evaluation of SVM performance with different values of the cost parameter $' C '$ and various kernel functions.

- **Homework 3** (Placeholder):
  Future homework assignments will be added here, covering additional machine learning topics and applications.
