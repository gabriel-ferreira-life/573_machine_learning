    '''
    Use different value of cost c to train a svm model. Then apply the trained model
    on testing label and data.
    
    The value of cost c you need to try is listing as follow:
    c = [0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
    Please set kernel to 'linear' and keep other parameter options as default.
    No return value is needed
